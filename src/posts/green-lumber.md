# Green Lumber, Red Lumber

I find myself musing over a paradoxical truth in the world of investing and entrepreneurship — — a realm where book smarts don’t always equate to street smarts, and the “idiots” sometimes sprint ahead of the intellectuals. It’s a cold, hard, somewhat amusing reality that keeps smacking me in the face, especially as someone who’s always clung to the comfort of linear narratives and the sanctity of well-bound textbooks.

I used to be that person. The one who thought mastering the intricacies of macroeconomics and being able to make intricate Excel models in my sleep was my ticket to the top. The kind of person who believed that to succeed in investing or running a company, you needed a laundry list of qualifications: a stint at McKinsey, an MBA from an Ivy League, or at the very least, a bookshelf groaning under the weight of economic theories.

But here’s the kicker — — life, in its usual, ironic manner, loves to upend such neat, orderly assumptions. It turns out that some of the most successful traders and entrepreneurs are those whose resumes might make the average academic snort in disdain. We’re talking about people who wouldn’t know how to calculate the GDP of a country but somehow just “get” market trends and business opportunities (and being able to act on them, of course).

So, what’s their secret? Are they just lucky? Or is there something hidden beneath the shell of their “ignorance”?

Consider the Green Lumber Fallacy, a concept I stumbled upon in Taleb’s Antifragile. It’s about a successful lumber trader who thought “green lumber” was wood painted green, not freshly cut lumber. Yet, he made a fortune trading it. This guy didn’t get bogged down in the academic weeds; he focused on what mattered — — the order flow.

This brings me to my reluctant conclusion. Maybe… just maybe… there’s more to success than just understanding the theories and the narratives. Maybe it’s about cutting through the crap and seeing what really moves the needle in the real world. It’s about action, not just contemplation; about being at the coalface and not just observing from a safe, academic distance.

Now, I’m not saying that education and intelligence are worthless. Far from it. But perhaps they’re not the be-all and end-all we often make them out to be, especially in areas like investing/trading/entrepreneurship. The world, after all, is not a classroom.

Take technical analysis as an example. Those in my social circle often dismiss it as “fake voodoo.” I remember bringing it up at an investing club I joined in my freshman year and seeing the half-contained amusement and bafflement on others’ faces. Yet, some of the most successful traders I know keep an open mind about — — if not embrace — — it. They’re not interested in what looks good on paper; they’re interested in what works in the unpredictable, messy real world of the stock market.

So, maybe it’s time to open our minds a bit more. To acknowledge that sometimes, the unconventional and even the “idiotic” may hold the key to success in IRL (all cap). It’s about taking all that theory and putting it into action, testing it in the real world, and seeing what sticks and what falls apart. And who knows? Perhaps in that process, we’ll discover that the “idiots” were onto something after all.

Disclaimer: I still believe in knowledge, but more than anything else, I believe in wisdom. Between book-smarts and street-smarts there is a space. That’s where the magic happens.
